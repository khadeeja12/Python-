It's named after Monty Python: Unlike most programming languages with founders boasting PhDs in Computer Science, Python was named after the British comedy troupe Monty Python by its creator Guido van Rossum! He even admits he wanted a name that was "slightly irreverent, that would encourage a playful approach to programming."

Whitespace matters (kind of): Unlike most languages where you can indent lines however you want, Python relies on indentation to define code blocks. This can lead to some funny errors if you accidentally mess up your tabs and spaces. Imagine writing a joke and forgetting the punchline because it wasn't indented correctly!

Zen of Python: The official Python documentation includes a section called "The Zen of Python" which offers a set of guiding principles for Pythonic code. These principles include some gems like "Simple is better than complex" and "There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it." While these are serious guidelines, they are phrased in a way that makes them fun and memorable.
